            <p class="body-font ">
                Daemon Killer is an Action Horror game that I made with a group of Computer Science
                students for my capstone project using Unity. The 3 of us all wanted to create a game that was fun and
                retro-like that showcases our capabilities in coding. We gathered together for a few meetings to decide
                the work that needs to be done, and divided the work among us that makes the most sense.
                <br><br>
                The project was a 4 month long endeavor where the team would meet up once week, or more if deemed
                necessary.
                The Project Coordinator, Brian Brookwell, a professor at MacEwan University who specializes in game
                development, would also be there, listening in on our discussion and provided feedback on our progress.
                Most of the time, he was satisfactory with our direction and pace of development, because it matches our
                projected milestone goals for the month.
                <br><br>
                Collaboration was the key to our success. There are often times where I had to coordinate with our
                level design artist to come up with new gameplay mechanics to make a level more interesting. As such,
                we both discussed a lot on the limitations and possible ideas we could implement such as targetting
                environmental objects. New puzzles became available and depth was added to the game.

                    Large portions of the city is run-down and abandoned by the populace due to a surge of demons
                    appearing out of no where. These creatures feast on humans, hunting them down whenever and wherever
                    possible. The government has sent out a special division force where the humans are capable of
                    magic, specifically, able to infuse their weapons with elemental powers to deal with these demons.
                    A source of the demons has been determined to be inside an abandoned mansion far away from the city
                    and the special division is tasked to eliminate the source of the demons.

                    The gameplay is in real time and uses an action gauge that fills up over time, which allows the
                    player to act when it is full. When the gauge is full, the player enters targetting mode, where
                    targetable objects are selectable and a list of actions will appear. Any amount of actions are
                    permitted so long the player has enough energy to use all the actions. This allows the player for a
                    power play when they are in need of a crutch. However, be wary because the energy expended
                    exponentially increases
                    as more actions are queued up.

                    There are interactable objects scattered throughout the levels which add depth and strategy to the
                    game. One interactable object is the oil puddle where it may be lit with the power of fire to
                    explode nearby barrels. Be careful of the flames afterwards as it will hurt you if you cross its
                    path.
