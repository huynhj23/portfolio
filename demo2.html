                Wash Me is a small local car washing business that has everything done manually such as advertising,
                logistics, and payments being cash. Our group was tasked to analyze the local business and conduct User
                (UX) Research to understand the underlying problems of the current system and design a new system to
                solve the identified problems.
                <br><br>
                Using a qualitative research method like a semi-structured interview with the client, we were able to
                understand the expected customers, as well as the needs and wants of both the customer and the client
                that needs to be implemented in a mobile app to automate Wash Me's booking process.
                <br><br>
                Many different tools were used in the design process. One includes Task Flows which allows us to define
                clear user goals and steps to complete those goals, as well as identify any alternative path taken to
                reach that goal. Another tool used is personas, which captures expected customers preferences and needs
                from the Wash Me booking process. Wireframes were used as a low fidelity representation of the project
                and showed basic functionalities with minimal visual design. Finally, a high fidelity prototype was
                made, showing all functionalities and interactions along with visual design considered as well.

                    A semi-structured interview was used to identify the current issues of the current system of Wash
                    Me. It's semi-structured because there are both predetermined questions as well as ones that are
                    asked because of information gained from the interview. One key thing we identified is that there is
                    no automation of the system at all, including the booking process. The client may not be able to
                    pick up phone calls due to their part time work and a customer would be stuck waiting for a call
                    back. Another way to identify problems is by creating personas of not only customers, but employees
                    as well. An employee we came up with is one who loves working with cars and understands car
                    usage due to his summer trips with his family, and how frustrating it would be to not have time for
                    those trips. Using this knowledge, he expects there to be reminders and checklists at work to
                    deliver the highest quality without any worries that he would be missing anything, making work
                    time efficient and high quality.

                    Task flow is crucial in determining all the necessary steps to reach an end goal. By having an end
                    goal, we can create a process to reach that end goal step by step visually. Visualizing the steps
                    prevents errors because we can reiterate the path multiple times to see if it makes complete sense.
                    It also lets us visualize any unnecessary steps as we go through it.

                    First a low fidelity prototype is made using a wireframe. This wireframe allows us to capture the
                    process founded in the task flow in the previous step. Content and layout of the screen gives the
                    user a general sense of how the app should feel and look. Because it is a low fidelity prototype,
                    the colors and UI may not be fleshed out, and the key is to make the basic components both pleasant
                    to look at and use.

                    A high fidelity prototype is then used to finalize the product. We go in higher details on the color
                    and theme of the application, adding custom made icons to make it feel like an official application.
                    Most importantly, the prototype is interactable which makes us able to test the flow of the
                    application. If something feels wrong in client or user testing, we can fix it immediately and ask
                    questions on whether look of the UI or the placement of some elements being off. Accessibility
                    issues can be fully addressed as well.
